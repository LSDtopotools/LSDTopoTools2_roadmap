= LSDTopoTools 2.0 roadmap

This is a roadmap document so that we (LSDTopoTools developers, which could include anyone) can design *LSDTopoTools 2.0*.

The feature we would like to have in *LSDTopoTools 2.0* are:

* A single repository for all the code (rather than different repositories for different tools).
* More streamlined software distribution.
** Docker containers that have just the software you need
*** One with the standard *LSDTT 2.0 build*, so FFTW only. 
*** One with the point cloud library (for terrace and point cloud tools)
*** One with the python scripts
*** One with the ruby tools for documentation
** A conda distribution
** Installation that puts the programs in one's path so that they can call *LSDTopoTools 2.0* from anywhere within their file system (like GDAL).
*** We will need to change all the driver functions so they take 0, 1,or 2 arguments. 0 arguments looks for a default parameter file in the current directory. 1 argument a named parameter file, 2 arguments the directory of the parameter file and the parameter file itself.
* All of this with updated documentation reflecting *LSDTopoTools 2.0* structure.
